# Mobile-Price-Classification
The code you provided is a Python script that analyzes a mobile phone dataset. It performs univariate analysis by creating histograms, box plots, bar charts, and pie charts to visualize the distributions and relationships between different features of the dataset. It also uses correlation matrices and bar plots to show the relationship between different features and the target variable, price range. In future, it can applies several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, naive Bayes, and support vector machines, to build models for predicting the price range of mobile phones.
